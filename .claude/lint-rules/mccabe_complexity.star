# Starlark Lint Rule: McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity
#
# This rule checks that microflows don't exceed a McCabe complexity threshold.
# McCabe complexity measures the number of independent paths through code:
#   - Base complexity is 1
#   - Each decision point (IF, type check) adds 1
#   - Each loop adds 1
#   - Each error handler adds 1
#
# Thresholds:
#   1-10  : Simple, low risk
#   11-20 : Moderate complexity, moderate risk
#   21-50 : Complex, high risk
#   50+   : Untestable, very high risk
#
# Microflow properties:
#   .id              - Document ID
#   .name            - Simple name (e.g., "ProcessOrder")
#   .qualified_name  - Full name (e.g., "MyModule.ProcessOrder")
#   .module_name     - Module name
#   .microflow_type  - "MICROFLOW" or "NANOFLOW"
#   .description     - Documentation
#   .return_type     - Return type
#   .parameter_count - Number of parameters
#   .activity_count  - Number of activities
#   .complexity      - McCabe cyclomatic complexity
