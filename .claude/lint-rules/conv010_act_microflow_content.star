# CONV010: ACT_ Microflow Content Restriction
#
# Microflows prefixed with ACT_ are page action microflows. They should only
# contain UI-related activities:
#   - ShowFormAction (show page)
#   - CloseFormAction (close page)
#   - ShowHomeFormAction (show home page)
#   - ShowMessageAction (show message)
#   - DownloadFileAction (download file)
#   - SubMicroflow (call sub-microflow for logic delegation)
#
# Business logic should be delegated to SUB_ microflows.
# Requires FULL catalog (REFRESH CATALOG FULL).
