# Starlark Lint Rule: Data Changes Through Microflows
#
# This rule enforces that data changes (create, update, delete) should go
# through microflows to ensure proper validation. Direct page saves bypass
# validation logic and can lead to data integrity issues.
#
# The rule checks that for each persistent entity, there is at least one
# microflow that creates or changes it. Entities without associated
# data-change microflows may be relying on direct page commits.
#
# This rule requires REFRESH CATALOG FULL to populate the refs table.
#
# Available functions:
#   refs_to(target_name) - Returns list of references to the given target
#
# Reference properties:
#   .source_type  - Type of source (e.g., "MICROFLOW")
#   .source_name  - Qualified name of source
#   .target_type  - Type of target (e.g., "ENTITY")
#   .target_name  - Qualified name of target
#   .ref_kind     - Kind of reference ("create", "change", "retrieve", etc.)
#   .module_name  - Module containing the reference
