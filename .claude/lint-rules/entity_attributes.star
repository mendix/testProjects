# Starlark Lint Rule: Entity Attribute Count
#
# This rule checks that entities don't have too many attributes.
# Entities with many attributes often indicate:
#   - Missing normalization (split into related entities)
#   - God object anti-pattern
#   - Need for entity inheritance/generalization
#
# Entity properties:
#   .id                - Document ID
#   .name              - Simple name (e.g., "Customer")
#   .qualified_name    - Full name (e.g., "MyModule.Customer")
#   .module_name       - Module name
#   .entity_type       - "Persistent", "NonPersistent", or "View"
#   .description       - Documentation
#   .generalization    - Parent entity (if any)
#   .attribute_count   - Number of attributes
#   .access_rule_count - Number of access rules
#   .is_external       - True if entity is from an external service
