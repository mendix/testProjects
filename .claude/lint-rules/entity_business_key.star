# Starlark Lint Rule: Entity Business Key
#
# This rule checks that persistent entities have a unique, not-null attribute
# that can serve as a business key for identification across systems.
#
# Mendix internal IDs (auto-generated) are unique only within a single app.
# When sharing data between systems (integrations, migrations, external APIs),
# a business key is essential for reliable object identification.
#
# A business key should be:
#   - UNIQUE: Ensures no duplicates
#   - NOT NULL: Ensures every object has an identifier
#
# Common business key patterns:
#   - Code: String(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE (e.g., "CUST-001")
#   - ExternalID: String(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE (e.g., UUID from source system)
#   - Email: String(200) NOT NULL UNIQUE (for user entities)
#
# Uses the attributes_for(entity_qualified_name) function to query entity attributes.
