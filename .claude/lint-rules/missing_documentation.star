# Starlark Lint Rule: Missing Documentation
#
# This rule checks that entities and microflows have documentation.
# Good documentation helps with maintainability and onboarding new developers.
#
# Checks:
#   - Entities should have a description explaining their purpose
#   - Microflows should have a description explaining what they do
#
# Entity properties:
#   .description     - Documentation text
#
# Microflow properties:
#   .description     - Documentation text
